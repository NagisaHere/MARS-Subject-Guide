\chapter{General Advice}
There are many things that you can be doing alongside your studies. This section will cover advice from our executive team to help you make the most of your time at university.

\section{Get Involved}
% Add outreach to MARS once confirmed
A massive way to both maximise your uni experience and make yourself more employable is to (within reason) say yes to eveything. Within MARS, we have many opportunities for this, ranging from skills workshops, to industry networking, to competition teams. Outside of MARS, there are still ways to engage in extracurriculars in other forms, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://life.uq.edu.au/get-involved}{Get Involved (Volunteering)}
    \item \href{https://www.eait.uq.edu.au/current-students/eait-ambassadors}{EAIT Ambassador program}
    \item \href{https://ventures.uq.edu.au/}{UQ Ventures}
\end{itemize}

\section{Stay Up To Date}
It's very useful to keep yourself up to date with what is going on in the field, and stay aware of what opportunities are available. There are a number of mailing lists available, including the \href{https://lists.csiro.au/mailman/listinfo/robotics-australia-nz-list}{ARAA Robotics ANZ mailing list}, the \href{https://www.lists.kit.edu/sympa/info/robotics-worldwide}{KIT Robotics Worldwide mailing list}, and the \href{http://mailing.eu-robotics.net/info/community}{euRobotics AISBL mailing list}.

\section{Put Your Name Out There}
Don't be scared to make yourself known in the industry. A great way to do this is through getting yourself along to networking events and meeting people face-to-face. Networking events are always going to be limited in the number of companies that can be present, so another solution to get your name out there is through talent portals, such as our partner River City Labs' \href{https://rivercitylabs.acs.org.au/programs/internship-program.html}{intern portal}.
