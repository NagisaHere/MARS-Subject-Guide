\subsection*{Description}
This course provides an overview of a wide range of energy systems including energy production from renewable (solar, wind, hydro, ocean, biomass) and non-renewable (fossil and nuclear) resources in the context of climate change and energy transitions.
A range of engineering principles will be consolidated (i.e. mass \& energy balances, thermodynamic cycles, process optimisation \& power generation) in tandem with the application of sustainable development principles and business perspectives.
