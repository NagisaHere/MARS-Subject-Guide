\subsection*{Description}
The objective of this course is to give the students the theoretical basis \& practical skills in modern design of medium size digital systems in various technologies, with a focus on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).
The design methodology, systematically introduced \& used in the course, is based on simulation \& synthesis with hardware description language (VHDL) tools.
Topics covered in this course include: conceptual design step from requirements \& specification to simulation \& synthesis model in VHDL, design of complex controllers with Finite State Machines, design of sequential blocks with Controller-Datapath methodology, issues in design for testability, electrical \& timing issues in logic and system design, overview of implementation technologies with emphasis on advances in FPGAs.
