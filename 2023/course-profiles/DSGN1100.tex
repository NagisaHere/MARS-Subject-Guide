\subsection*{Description}
This course introduces the process of design from concept to outcome through critical thinking and experimentation.
It broadly focuses on the way that design creates interactions between people and contexts towards cultural and economic innovations.
Techniques of observation, analysis and representation will be used alongside methods of iteration and reflection to address identified issues or problems.
Learning is undertaken in a collaborative studio setting where students will develop a sensibility for the visual and spatial in design.
