\subsection*{Description}
Provides a solid understanding of the issues of concurrent programming - processes and threads, scheduling, synchronisation, communications, and data sharing - including their application in distributed systems.
The course covers methods for both the specification and verification of such systems at a high level of abstraction, and their implementation in a modern programming language.
