\subsection*{Description}
Current global problems require increasingly sophisticated materials and appropriate advanced approaches and methodologies for their manufacture.
This course will look at materials design for device manufacture, manufacturing techniques and manufacturing systems that are used to deliver innovative products and devices from the laboratory to industrial production.
Several key manufacturing techniques, such as nano-, electronic and sustainable manufacturing will be covered as case studies illuminating how materials and manufacturing processes affect the end performance of the product, the economics of production and the impact on society and the environment.
To obtain greater insight into smart manufacturing processes, students will complete projects, literature reviews/lab reports and oral/poster presentations in specific areas of manufacturing.
