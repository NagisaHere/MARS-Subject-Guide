\subsection*{Description}
Energy storage and conversion materials hold the key to many advanced renewable energy technologies including photo-voltaic systems, lithium-ion and next-generation batteries, hydrogen fuel cells and storage, and superconducting magnetic energy storage.
With the increasing need for safe, cost-effective and environmentally friendly methods of energy storage and conversion, it is necessary to accelerate the rate at which energy-related materials are developed.
Materials science is an essential enabling technology for emerging renewable technologies.
Often, engineering solutions for the energy challenges facing society are constrained by the materials technologies available.
This is especially true for energy storage and conversion materials.
The aim of this course on Materials for Energy Conversion and Storage is to help future engineers create and develop new materials solutions to meet this global challenge.
