\subsection*{Description}
Understanding of geomechanical behaviour of orebody and host rock is of critical importance to achieve safe and efficient mining operations and has become an integral part of a mine design and planning.
As mines are getting deeper, the ground in situ stress and water pressure are also increasing, which requires more in-depth understanding of rock mass to address this emerging grant challenge in deep mining.
This course provides students with a fundamental knowledge of rockmass properties, and with a practical understanding of the applications of geotechnical engineering principles in mining from the perspective of planning, design, and operations.
This will enable students to understand and apply fundamental concepts and design methodologies to design safe excavations in both surface and underground mines.
