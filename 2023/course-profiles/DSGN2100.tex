\subsection*{Description}
This course focuses on design thinking as a facilitator of social and cultural organisation in public settings.
It looks particularly at incorporating intercultural awareness into the arrangement and understanding of places reflecting diverse cultures within Australia and globally.
Students will understand how people take cues from their surroundings and deploy that knowledge in response to a set design project.
Learning is undertaken in a collaborative studio setting where students will develop a sensibility for strategic design thinking.
