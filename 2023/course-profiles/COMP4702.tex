\subsection*{Description}
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the development \& application of adaptive algorithms that use example data or previous experience to solve a given problem.
Topics include: learning problems (e.g regression, classification, unsupervised, reinforcement) \& theory, neural networks, statistical \& probabilistic models, clustering, ensembles, implementation issues, applications (e.g. bioinformatics, cognitive science, forecasting, robotics, signal \& image processing).
