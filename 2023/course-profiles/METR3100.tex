\subsection*{Description}
METR3100 introduces students to engineering frameworks that support the design and implementation of safe, robust control systems.
Students are shown how to identify and mitigate against hazards using a system theoretic approach to managing risk.
The course also explores the operating principles of sensing, logic, and actuation subsystems that comprise an overall control system.
