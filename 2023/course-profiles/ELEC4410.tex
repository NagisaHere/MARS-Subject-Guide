\subsection*{Description}
This course is about power processing using control, signal processing and electronic systems.
The application can be from many Mega Watts in an electric train or a wind farm to less than a few Watts in a digital camera or a mobile phone.
For modern power electronics system, computer simulation tools are used to analyse and optimise a design before any prototyping.
Topics covered in this course are a) power electronic systems and applications such as motor drive, renewable energy and power supply systems; b) energy conversion topologies; c) modelling and control; d) design factors and computer simulations.
