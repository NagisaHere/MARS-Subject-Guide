\chapter{About MARS}
The \textit{UQ Mechatronics And Robotics Society} is a student-led hub for passion and innovation in robotics and automation.
Connecting members across disciplines and year levels, the society aims to foster a strong community centered on the practical development of robotics.
Aspiring engineers have the opportunity to connect through our hosted workshops, seminars and competition teams.
