\chapter{Introduction}
    The 2023 UQ MARS Subject Guide has been created to guide all MARS members through their degree. This is a comprehensive guide that will present suggested program structures, enrolment plans, course profiles, and offer the chance to inform students of the specific pathways available within Mechatronics Engineering. We will aim to give specialised advice from our Exec team and various UQ MARS Alumni regarding study advice, course selection and general career advice. \\
    \\ The \textbf{UQ Mechatronics and Robotics Society} is also commmited to not just Mechatronics Engineering students, but also various student engineers studying in adjacent fields; This includes Electrical, Mechanical, Computer, Software specialisations, as well as people in similar degrees such as Computer Science and I.T. \\
    \\ The guide will be divided into the following sections: \\
    \\ The \textbf{Recommended Enrolment Plan} is a template made by the MARS execs to provide a simple enrolment plan and leaves rooms for electives as desired. \\
    \\ \textbf{Course Reviews and Advice} contains specific details and advice for courses required in the BE(Hons) in Mechatronic Engineering and the BE/ME programs, alongside some courses in the Computer Engineering Major; as a lot of our members take these as electives. \\
