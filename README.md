# MARS-Subject-Guide

This repository is the home to the UQ MARS Mechatronics Course Guide.

The course guide is a document to help UQ students studying mechatronic engineering and related disciplines in choosing their courses and planning their degrees. The guide presents recommended enrolment plans for the [mechatronic](https://study.uq.edu.au/study-options/programs/bachelor-engineering-honours-2455/mechatronic-engineering-mectre2455) specialisation in the [Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)](https://study.uq.edu.au/study-options/programs/bachelor-engineering-honours-2455) program, as well as the [mechatronic](https://study.uq.edu.au/study-options/programs/bachelor-engineering-honours-and-master-engineering-2350/mechatronic-engineering-mectrx2350) field of study in the [Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Master of Engineering](https://study.uq.edu.au/study-options/programs/bachelor-engineering-honours-and-master-engineering-2350) program. There are also suggested electives for those in electrical, mechanical, software engineering, or computer science who may wish to pursue studies aligned with the discipline of mechatronic engineering.

The document also contains course profiles for each of the courses mentioned in these earlier sections of the document, providing both summary information provided by the university, as well as student input based on their experiences.

## Contributing

This is an open-source document for the purpose of the MARS community being able to update the document as the program evolves and courses change. To ensure that the document is always kept in the correct condition, the following steps should be followed by anyone contributing (or else you changes will likely be ignored):

1. Begin by creating a fork of the repository from which you can make edits and adjustments, and make all changes in this fork. The change should only be submitted by means of a pull request back to the main repository.
2. All pull requests should have one specific purpose to minimise the separate revisions that need to be made. For example, if changing a course review and updating an enrolment plan, these should be separated into different PRs. To make this easier to implement, it is recommended that you branch before making any updates, as a separate branch can be made for each PR.
3. Ensure that no changes are made such that anyone is targeted or singled out. The student input here is valuable for others seeking advice on courses, but that does not mean that this document is a place for targeted aggression towards any staff members. Keep the content of reviews relating just to the content that a course covers, the time commitment associated with it, the quality of the teaching materials, and similar.
4. Always ensure that you publish the updated pdf with your changes, compiled as per the included Makefile (if using something like overleaf, you may need to adjust the compiler, and manually download and replace the pdf).
