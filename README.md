# MARS-Subject-Guide
Guide for STEM students interested in Mechatronics and Robotics.

We are currently developing a comprehensive course guide to aid students in the selection of their courses. The guide will present suggested program structures, enrolment plans, course profiles, and offer the chance to inform students of the specific pathways available within Mechatronics and adjacent specialisations such as Electrical/Computer Engineering. We will aim to give specialised advice from our Exec team and various UQ MARS Alumni regarding study advice, course selection and general career advice.
